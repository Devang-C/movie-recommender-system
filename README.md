# Movie Recommender Model

This is a machine learning model that provides personalized movie recommendations based on a user's input. The model analyzes data on various movie attributes, such as genre, rating, and director, to provide recommendations that match the user's preferences.
Requirements

    Python 3.x
    NumPy
    Pandas

Installation

    Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/Devang-C/movie-recommender-system.git
    Install required packages(In the Notebook Itself) : pip install numpy, pip install pandas, pip install -U scikit-learn, pip install nltk
                                                        
                                                        
                                                        
   
Usage

    Go to the last cell of the notebook, and run the `recommend` function
    Provide name of movie as the function parameter(in form of string)
    The model will provide a list of movie recommendations based on similar attributes, such as genre, rating, and director.

Interface

Currently, the model does not have an interface. However, I am planning to create a user-friendly interface using Streamlit, a Python library for creating web applications, to enhance the user experience and make the model more accessible.
